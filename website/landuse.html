          To manufacture clothes, raw materials requiring land cultivation are needed. The textile production is the third most land-intensive industry following 
          food and housing 
          <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/textiles-and-the-environment-the/textiles-and-the-environment-the"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
          Land use agricultural areas for materials, human settlement and waste disposal. Only 1% of used clothes are recycled into new clothes,
          the other are either reused or thrown away. On average, Europeans use nearly 26 kilos of textiles annually, and discard about 11 kilos of them. 
          Most used clothes are exported outside the EU to be incinerated or landfilled.

          Natural textiles, like cotton from China and India, require vast land areas, as do animal-based fibers such as wool.  
          The choice of fabrics in clothing production is crucial to take into account as these processes are typically resource- and land-intensive. 
          And, sadly, those types of culture badly impact their environments by reducing wilderness and threatening biodiversity around it.

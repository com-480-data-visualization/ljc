                The carbon footprint of clothes measures the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, throughout 
                its life cycle from raw material production to its end-of-life disposal. The key contributors to these emissions include <b>energy consumption</b>, 
                <b>fossil fuel use</b>, and the <b>production of the materials</b> such as fibers or dyes. During manufacturing, the use of chemicals and heat further adds 
                to greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, <b>transportation</b> involves moving the raw materials, components and finished products usually over 
                long-distance travel resulting in huge emissions. Even after purchase, consumers contribute to emissions through the electricity used for <b>washing</b>, 
                <b>drying</b> or <b>ironing</b> clothes.

                To visualize the contribution of each domain, here is the repartition of the greenhouse gas emissions during all the life of a cotton t-shirt. 
                It is computed in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>eq) which is the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> which would warm the earth as much as the sum 
                of all the emitted greenhouse gas:

            <p>Thus, the fashion industry has an important impact on these emissions, estimated as <b>10% of global carbon emissions</b>. 
                According to the European Environment Agency, textile products consumed in the EU generated <b>121 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions</b>. 
                Nowadays, climate change is highly driven by the human emissions of greenhouse gas, making it crucial to reduce these emission

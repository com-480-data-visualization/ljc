                The fashion industry is a significant consumer and polluter of freshwater resources. 
                Water is required at every stage of clothes production, such as for cultivating plants and raising animals for fabrics or dyeing and treating the 
                materials during manufacturing. Unfortunately, poorly managed wastewater from these processes often ends up back in our water systems, potentially 
                contaminated with toxic and heavy metals. Water is also consumed during the lifespan of clothes, especially during cleaning. 
                Some fabrics, such as the polyester, shed microfibers when washed, contributing to ocean pollution and ecosystem degradation.

                Thus, managing water resources in the fashion industry goes beyond simply considering water usage in raw material cultivation.
                Unfortunately, most of the big brands donâ€™t do much to prioritize improvements in water management practices.

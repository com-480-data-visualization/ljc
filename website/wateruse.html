            <p>The fashion industry is a significant <b>consumer and polluter of freshwater resources</b>. 
            Water is required at every stage of clothes production, such as for cultivating plants and raising animals for fabrics or dyeing and treating the 
            materials during manufacturing, but the volume depends on the product:
            
            <div id="water-usage-comparison"></div>

            <p>In addition to the high water consumption, poorly managed wastewater from these processes often ends up back in our water systems, potentially 
            contaminated with toxic and heavy metals. </p>
            
            <p>To produce one single cotton t-shirt, <b>2700 liters</b> of water is consumed. But that's not all - water is also consumed during the lifespan of clothes, especially during cleaning. 
            And this process is also contributing to <b>ocean pollution and ecosystem degradation</b>. Indeed, some fabrics such as the polyester, shed microfibers when washed.

            <p>Thus, managing water resources in the fashion industry goes beyond simply considering water usage in raw material cultivation.
            Unfortunately, most of the big brands donâ€™t do much to prioritize improvements in water management practices.</p>
